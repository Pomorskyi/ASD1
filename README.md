# Instructions

For a given sequence of natural numbers, the program is to find the longest monotonic substring and return its length, as well as the sum of its elements.

# Input:

A sequence of natural numbers of at least 1 length in the form of numbers separated by a space.

# Output:

Length and the sum of the elements of the longest monotone sequence, in the form of two numbers separated by a space.

# Requirements

• Time complexity O (n).

• O (1) memory complexity.

• The program must accept input from the file whose location is given in the first parameter of the program invocation.

• The only thing that the program prints must be a line containing the answer. • The whole solution must be contained in one file. ) until midnight. Two points are deducted for each day of delay

• Allowed languages ​​are Java, C, C ++ and C #

• We assume that the input data is correct

• In case of several substrings of the same length, take into account the one previously in the string

• It is forbidden to use ready-made solutions from Java (or other), such as ArrayList , be a StringBuilder. The exceptions are those solutions that are used for I / O operations (eg Scanner in Java) and the String class and methods on it.

# Example

For the input data "3 6 12 4 7 19 20 20 9 11" the program should give "5 70" as the answer.
